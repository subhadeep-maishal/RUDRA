The hybrid neural network for ocean applications combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This innovative model excels in processing oceanic data, enhancing predictions, and generating realistic simulations. Its fusion of image analysis, sequential learning, and generative capabilities advances oceanic research and analysis.
